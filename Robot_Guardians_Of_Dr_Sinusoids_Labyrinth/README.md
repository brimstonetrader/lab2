Jealous Doctor's Parrot
  
The intent of this game is to illustrate the madness that envy can drive one towards, with regards to the infliction of pain onto parrots.

The narrative is multifaceted, incorporating two theme words. At the beginning, the seemingly trustworthy Dr. Sinusoid tells you not to touch his robots. If you do, however, they'll tell you about the doctor's dark side. The doctor is not a good roboticist. If you get to the center of his maze, his weary former parrot tells you his tale, then informs you that you are trapped in the labyrinth, forever, just like all the other robots, singing a twisted song.

You can control the character with WASD, and talk to robots by colliding with them.

The aesthetics are intentionally grey and depressing, as the game takes place in a mythological forever labyrinth. The robots are grey, too. The protagonist and Dr. Sinusoid provide a bit of color, but it is a false hope.

We had fun coming up with the circular, sine function based movement, and writing the dialogue. It was difficult to wrangle with GitKraken, as always, and to debug, especially when we were syncing the Scripts to the GameObjects.

We both worked to gather sprites, instantiate and debug code, and playtest. Noah wrote the README and SineWaveMovement.cs, Robot.cs, got most of the scripts from the example to work in context, and Justin created the restart button.
